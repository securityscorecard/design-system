## From version 1.x to 2.0.0

### Monospace font is not bundled

Design System 2.0.0 does not bundle monospace (Space Mono) font with the package anymore. We decided to remove font files from the package to save package size. We are providing guide how to install needed fonts in our Storybook Docs.
