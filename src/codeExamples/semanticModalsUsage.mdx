## Using semantic modals

Several different popup actions notify the user about what is going on around the platform. Notifications through the Toast component inform him about successful action results, and about what will eventually need the user's attention. The Toast component is mostly not related to the user's immediate actions - so how do we notify the user about immediate problems?

Inside the forms, whenever there's an error, the user gets an error message. When the user clicks on a button and the following action might cause some problems, it's good to send out an alert and ask the user to either proceed with the desired action or cancel it. That's what semantic modals are for.

The difference between notification and semantic modal is that notification displays the information and through actions leads you to where the problem is (another space), whereas the semantic modal allows you to execute the action directly.
