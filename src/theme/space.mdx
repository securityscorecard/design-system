# Space

Spacing is an important part of design system. Instead of using arbitrary amounts of spacing
in our components and layouts, we are limiting ourselves to standardised spacing scale.

## Scale

Our scale is based on "power of two" rule with several custom steps to smooth the scale. Each of
the customized steps is marked with the `Plus` suffix.

<SpaceScale scale={theme.space} />

## Stacking

For stacking we can use any value from our scale and we can stack both vertically and horizontally.
In code the stacking is implemented by margins.

## Inseting

We have three different kinds of inset:

1. `square` - vertical and horizontal inset are equal
2. `squish` - vertical inset is half of horizontal
3. `stretch` - horizontal inset is half of vertical

Each inset kind has only restricted set of values from the scale (see below). In code inset is
implemented by padding.
