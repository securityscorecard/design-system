## What is this?

This is a small package for running visual regressions in storybook locally

This is separated from main package json, so some time can be saved building the docker image
Normally you should never use this package directly, just use `design-system`'s package.json and launch
`yarn test:storybook:visual` to launch checking and `yarn test:storybook:visual:update` to update
snapshots
